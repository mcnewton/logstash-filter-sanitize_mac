# Sanitize MAC addresses
#
# Many logs contain MAC addresses, but they can arrive in several different
# formats, such as colon-delimited (00:11:22:aa:bb:cc), hyphen-delimited, Cisco
# format (aabb.ccdd.1122), or just plain hex (001122334455). They can also be
# uppercase, lowercase or mixed. This is especially problematic in logs such as
# from a RADIUS server where clients are not all under local control and can
# contain many different formats. This filter makes it easy to convert MAC
# addresses into the same pattern to make searching easier.
#
# Examples:
#
#     # Create new field "client_mac_sanitized" with copy of "client_mac" field
#     # in lowercase colon-delimited format.
#     filter {
#       sanitize_mac {
#         match => { "client_mac" => "client_mac_sanitized" }
#         separator => ":"
#         fixcase => "lower"
#       } 
#     } 
#
#    # Replace "client_mac" and "server_mac" fields with versions in uppercase
#    # Cisco format.
#     filter {
#       sanitize_mac {
#         match => { "client_mac" => "client_mac"
#                    "server_mac" => "server_mac" }
#         separator => "."
#         fixcase => "upper"
#       } 
#     }
